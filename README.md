# CS250_Roguelike_Deckbuilder

This will be a turn-based, roguelike deck builder game in which the player fights monsters using battle cards, each with its own ability. The cards’ power will increase after every monster’s defeat. Over the course of the game, the player will gain increasingly stronger cards, eventually fighting and defeating the final boss at the end.

Our goal is to create a fun, challenging game that combines action, battles, abilities, and adventure, all while pushing the boundaries of creativity.
